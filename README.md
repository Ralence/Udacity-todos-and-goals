# Udacity Todos and Goals

## Info

This in-class project is a part of Udacity's React Developer Nanodegree program. The purpose of coding this project is to understand how Redux works internally. To do this we used vanilla JavaScript to write a state management library and connect it to our simple Todo and Goals app.
